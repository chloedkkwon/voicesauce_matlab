## How to
1. Download the above .m files in your VoiceSauce folder.
3. In `func_PraatPitch.m` and `func_PraatFormants.m`, go to the line where it declares `praat_path.` Change this directory to your Praat path.
   - If your OS is LINUX, you'll have to add conditionals to set the Praat path (use `isunix()` in MATLAB). 
5. In `run_voicesauce_remote.m`, go to the line with `cd PATH`. Change this path to your path to the VoiceSauce folder.
   - For running in a single folder, run this command in MATLAB: `run_voicesauce_remote(AUDIOFOLDER);`
     OR in the command line: 
     ```bash
     matlab -nojvm -nodisplay -r "run_voicesauce_remote(AUDIOFOLDER); exit;"
     ```
6. You can reference `run_voicesauce_all_remote.m` to see how I looped over different file directories and set different F0 parameters based on gender.
